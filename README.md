# CMP_SC 3330 Assignment 2 README File

## Explanation of Project
This java project is to create a program that will control and manage various information regarding students. 
This program allows a user to view and manage information about students by reading information from a file, searching for stduents based off their ID, and updating their grades.

This project is managed by four different files:
- "Student.java": This file creates a Student class with attributes for the student's ID, name, and grade.
- "studentManager.java": Tis file creates the Student Manager class which contains the methods to be used and handles the main logic for the program.
- "Main.java": This file is the main file that is used for the user to execute the code.
- "studentData.txt": A text file including the information of the students.

## Methods of the Project
This program allows a user to do the following reagrding student information:
- Read student infromation from a file and initialize objects.
- Displays student information to user.
- Search for a specific student given their ID.
- Update a specific students grade by their ID.

## Dependencies
The following are the dependecies for the project:
- Java to compile and run the program (JDK 20).
- An IDE that can run Java projects (ie. Eclipse).

## How to Run Project
To run the project access the GitHub page to be able to access the program which should include "Student.java", "studentManager.java", "Main.java" and the text file. To run the program use an IDE, such as Eclipse, and import the project from the repository to the IDE. Next, assuming that JDK is installed on your machine compile and run the code through the IDE. The user can use "Main.java" to display all the student information and access all methods.
